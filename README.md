A Simple Command-Line WordPress Version Checker.

This is a little tool I wrote to find compromised WordPress installs in a shared hosting environment. 
Written in PHP, to be run from an SSH session.
The lone file can be placed in your PATH somewhere, and then called simply by invoking its name in the base directory of a given WordPress install.
